# Starquest: Gamification of Astronomy #

Starquest is a web-based gamification application that aims to promote engagement in practical astronomy and support learning outcomes.

## Gamification of astronomical observing ##

Users are encouraged to make astronomical ovservations through a series of _missions_ and _challnges_.
Observations are recorded in a personal observing log which is used to assess progress through the missions.
Completing the observing channlenges and/or missions may unlock _achievements_ (usually in the form of _badges_).
Users may also gain access to additional missions as the progress.

Observing log entries must be approved by a moderator.
This ensures that observations are genuine and that users are not "gaming the system".

The system will have features for organizing group observing sessions and bulk-adding observations on behalf of attendees.

The system can send email notifications to users when observing log entries are approved or rejected,
when they unlock achievements or as reminders of upcoming events.
